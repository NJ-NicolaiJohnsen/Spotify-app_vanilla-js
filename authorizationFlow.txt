In order to have access to the spotify API, you need an access token.
You can get an access token by exchanging and authorization code for it.
The authorization code is determines the scope of the application, meaning
what the application is allowed to do and what not to do.

1. Login and retrive authorization code --> GET "https://accounts.spotify.com/authorize?client_id=" + client_id + "&response_type=code&redirect_uri=" +redirect_uri+ "&scope=" + scope

2. Authorize code and request access token --> POST https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token with the body:  `code=${code}&redirect_uri=${redirect_uri}&grant_type=authorization_code`  

3. Use the access token to make requests to Spotify API
